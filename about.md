I am Lester Lee, a Computer Science major at Williams College. This website documents my independent study on information visualization with  [Iris Howley](http://cs.williams.edu/~iris/).

_Description_

People have access to an increasingly staggering amount of information, and one way of processing such vast amounts of data is through visualization. This independent study will delve into the field of information visualization and understand in detail how visualization can be used to explore and explain complex data. I will learn the principles behind information visualization, how to evaluate and critically critique visualizations, and how to transform datasets into effective visualizations.
