talk about working with wcma, seeing where viz might be useful, who the audience or use may be, what is currently working with browsing collection

overall theme is to find a way to visually browse the collection, so find what people are looking for, what may be useful

focus more on the viz part so not doing extensive research, but many further questions that could be asked later on:

right now, get a general sense of what people may be looking for, also have to think about what is possible given the constraints of the data and time, should start working on building basic visualizations

have already been playing with the dataset, but have noticed that visualization will require, of course, visual properties of artworks, so start extracting information from the thumbnails
