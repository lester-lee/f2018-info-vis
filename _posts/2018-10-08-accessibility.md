Information visualizations need to have an audience, and it is important for us to keep in mind who our audience will be. If we have a message that we want to communicate, we should make sure that everyone is able to receive and understand that message. By making our visualizations accessible, we will be able to reach more people.

As [this Storytelling with Data post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2018/6/26/accessible-data-viz-is-better-data-viz), puts it:
> **Accessible data-viz is better data-viz.**

The post itself gives 5 tips on how to make a visualization more accessible, and links to more resources, such as [this data visualization style guide by Amy Cesal](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/data-visualization/data-visualization.html).

## General Guidelines
The audience of a visualization is important. What is their reading level? How much do they already know about the topic? What types of charts are they used to? How much jargon will they understand? What information are they looking for? 

Ideally, these questions would be answered through extensive interaction and observation of the intended audience, as well as previous research, but this is not always possible. Sometimes we have to design for a wider audience, who we may or may not be familiar with. It is especially in these cases that we follow general guidelines and try to make our visualizations as accessible as possible, so that we do not unintentionally inhibit a potential viewer from understanding what we are trying to visualize.

Though the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) cover a wide range of content, there are some important things to keep in mind for visualizations that are meant to be seen in( a browser. They provide a quick reference that uses the [POUR](http://www.dynamit.com/accessibility-principles/) accessibility principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, robust). WCAG provides links to in-depth discussions of how these principles can be applied.

## Perceivable
I went in-depth on using more accessible color choices in [a previous post on visual perception]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/09/17/visualperception/), but color choice is not the only thing that can be improved. 

Using larger and legible fonts makes text easier to read for everyone!
