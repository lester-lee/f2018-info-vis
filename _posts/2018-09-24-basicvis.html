title: Basic Visualizations
---
<p>The goal of the following visualizations is for me to get some practice using visualization tools and to get a feel for creating different types of visualizations.</p>
<p>I will be using the following dataset: [3,29,10,5,50,27,19]. The numbers do not represent anything; this is just for me to become familiar with reading in data and generating a visualization using those numbers.</p>
