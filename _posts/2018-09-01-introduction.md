This blog will document my process as I read and learn about information visualization. By the end of the semester, I hope to have gained a solid grasp of how and why information is visualized, as well as be able to both create and critically evaluate information visualizations. I'll be thinking about questions like: What makes a visualization good? What isn't working about a certain visualization? What are the theories and techniques behind visualizing different types of datasets?

## What is information visualization?
At its core, information visualization is about transforming data into visual representations. These visualizations can be used to explore a dataset, to glean information that may not have been readily accessible from the original dataset. Visualizations can be used to present information to an audience who may not be familiar with the dataset.

Visualizations can vary a lot, whether in purpose, aesthetics, or effectiveness. They can look like this:

Further along this semester I will delve deeper into what exactly makes a good (or bad) visualization, and qualities to look out for while analyzing and creating visualizations.

## Why visualize?
Personally, I find myself understanding new material much better when it is visually presented.

Visualization enables the viewer to quickly process large amounts of data.

A visualization may reveal patterns that were previously obscured, unnoticed trends in the data. For example, consider Anscombe's quartet, which are datasets created to illustrate this purpose.[^1] These four scatterplots each contain eleven points and have nearly identical descriptive statistics. When graphed, however, one can quickly see that they have distinctively different patterns.
