This blog will document my independent study on information visualization. By the end of the semester, I hope to have gained a solid grasp of how and why information is visualized, as well as be able to both create and critically evaluate information visualizations. This introduction will be my first step into the field of information visualization, and there will be a lot of unanswered questions as I think about the material that I come across. These blog posts will hopefully illuminate my process of trying to answer the questions that arise, and in doing so, will serve as a record of what I've learned.

## What is information visualization?
Information visualization is all about transforming data into visual representations. These visualizations can be used to explore a dataset, to glean information that may not have been readily accessible from the original dataset. Or they can be used to present information to an audience who may not be familiar with the dataset. Visualizations may also be used to confirm ideas about a dataset. [^1] Regardless, their purpose is to _communicate_ the data.

Visualizations can look like this:

or even this:

Data visualizations come in all forms, but as a mode of communication, they raise some valuable questions. What's the purpose of each visualization? What are they trying to communicate? What were the choices involved in making each visualizaton? Are they effective visualizations?

## Data visualizations are designs.
Creating a visualization is a design process. It involves sketches, prototypes, testing, iteration, evaluation. You have to think about aesthetics, the goal, the audience, what's being communicated.

Further along this semester I will delve deeper into what exactly makes a good (or bad) visualization, and qualities to look out for while analyzing and creating visualizations.

## Why visualize?
Personally, I find myself understanding new material much better when it is visually presented. In [_The Functional Art_](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/), Cairo much more elegantly describes data visualizaton as preemptively aiding the transformation of raw data into wisdom[^X]. A visualization helps us understand information more quickly and more efficiently by adding structure and order to the data so that the viewer doesn't have to do it themselves.

It is important to keep in mind that not every visualization may add the correct structure or order, or present the right data. Some visualizations may even aim to mispresent the data, so even though work is being done for the viewer, the viewer must be cognizant of what that work is.

A visualization may reveal patterns that were previously obscured, unnoticed trends in the data. For example, consider Anscombe's quartet, which are datasets created to illustrate this purpose.[^X] These four scatterplots each contain eleven points and have nearly identical descriptive statistics. When graphed, however, one can quickly see that they have distinctively different patterns.
