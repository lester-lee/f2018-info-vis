title: Basic Visualizations
---
The goal of the following visualizations is for me to get some practice using visualization tools and to get a feel for creating different types of visualizations. The Javascript is [{{site.baseurl}}/assets/basicvis/visualize.js]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/basicvis/visualize.js)

I will be using the following dataset:
>[16, 28, 11, 3, 40, 10, 3, 34, 45, 34, 17, 26, 41, 45, 15, 0, 23, 45, 21, 30]

The numbers do not represent anything; this is just for me to become familiar with reading in data and generating a visualization using those numbers.

These are done using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). 
The basic scheme of using D3 is to:
 1. Append **svg** element to div
 2. Attach data to the svg
 3. Figure out the correct axes scaling
 4. Append appropriate svg shapes & corresponding attributes

Using external D3 libraries would make this process go a lot faster. I wanted to get some experience using just D3 to create charts before using libraries while D3 code definitely makes it a lot easier to programatically generate svg from data

## Bar Charts

<div class="HorizontalBar"></div>
### Vertical Bars
