A big part of information visualization is, of course, the data. This week I delve into examining datasets and how different types of visualizations may be better suited for different types of datasets. How should a certain dataset be visualized? What types of data shouldn't be visualized?

## Exploration and Presentation
When encountering a new dataset, the right visualization to use isn't immediately apparent. It shouldn't be! We should play around with different visualizations and try different angles of approaching the dataset. We have to explore the dataset visually [^explore].
