title: More practice with D3
---
This week is more practice with D3, using the [WCMA dataset](https://github.com/wcmaart/collection). I am using [C3](https://c3js.org/), a D3-based library.

## Artwork Mediums
Originally I wanted to do a count of the mediums, but upon looking at the mediums, this would be a little harder to categorize, since the descriptions vary from "damask with fish, with resist dye, indigo and a mask" to "watercolor on paper, mounted to panel". I would have to do a little more analysis of the medium descriptions to get a better sense of how they can be categorized. However, each piece has a classification such as "WCMA-PRINTS" and "WCMA_SCULPTURE", which is much more consistent and easier to work with.
