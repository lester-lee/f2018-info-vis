## Processing exhibition data
In addition to the visual features from last time, I've also processed exhibition data to get a better sense for how pieces may be related to each other. I used [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) to construct a graph where each node represents a work of art in the collection and an edge between two nodes represents an exhibit that both were in. My code can be found at [`make_exhibit_graph.py`](https://github.com/lester-lee/wcma-viz/blob/master/make_exhibit_graph.py). The simplest way to visualize this information may be something like this:

First, an overview of the collection. The nodes / artworks may be represented by thumbnails, colored shapes, text, etc. Faint edges represent connections between pieces.

![Sketch of overview of collection as described above]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/exhibit_1.png)

Upon zooming in on a particular piece in the overview, more detailed information about the piece is pulled up, such as medium, artist, time created, etc., and the piece's connections to other works are highlighted.

![Sketch of zooming in on a particular piece as described above]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/exhibit_2.png)

Clicking on one of these collections will put the new piece into focus, and highlight the new piece's connections.

![Sketch of details about another piece, as described above]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/exhibit_3.png)

Something like this will allow an audience to quickly get a sense of the collection as well as what connections between pieces exist, and also to zoom it on a particular piece to get more information. Filters may be used to limit the number of artworks that appear in the graph, allowing users to see connections given certain constraints: for example, how connected are prints? How connected are monochrome photographs?
