## Processing exhibition data
In addition to the visual features from last time, I've also processed exhibition data to get a better sense for how pieces may be related to each other. I used [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) to construct a graph where each node represents a work of art in the collection and an edge between two nodes represents an exhibit that both were in. My code can be found at [`make_exhibit_graph.py`](https://github.com/lester-lee/wcma-viz/blob/master/make_exhibit_graph.py). The simplest way to visualize this information may be something like this:

First, an overview of the collection. The nodes / artworks may be represented by thumbnails, colored shapes, text, etc. Faint edges represent connections between pieces.

![Sketch of overview of collection as described above]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/exhibit_1.png)

Upon zooming in on a particular piece in the overview, more detailed information about the piece is pulled up, such as medium, artist, time created, etc., and the piece's connections to other works are highlighted.

Clicking on one of these collections will put the new piece into focus, and highlight the new piece's connections.

Something like this will allow an audience to quickly get a sense of the collection as well as what connections between pieces exist, and also to zoom it on a particular piece to get more information. Filters may be used to limit the number of artworks that appear in the graph, allowing users to see connections given certain constraints: for example, how connected are prints? How connected are monochrome photographs?

## Some Ideas
Now that I have a good amount of data to play with, I can start sketching out some ideas for visualizing relationships in the dataset.

### RGB Distribution
How green (or red or blue) is the collection?
how (green, red, blue) is the collection?

### Time & Color
How has the color makeup of the collection changed over time? Are there moments in the collection's history when the dominant colors of the palette were drastically different? Is there a relationship between the creation date of an object and its color palette?

One way of visualizing this information would be a scalable timeline that starts from the earliest date to current times. The colors could be represented as liquids in a pot, paints on a palette, sections of a rectangle, etc.

![Sketch of timeline and colors on a palette, as described above]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/timecolor_1.png)

![Sketch of timeline and colors as liquids in a pot.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/timecolor_2.png)

Dragging either end of the timeline will update the colors.

Focusing on a specific point in time will show the color scheme for that point.

### Category & Color
Another relationship to think about is the color palette of each classification of the collection. For example, how different in color are the prints compared to the sculptures? This could be a standalone visualization, but also an addition to the previous timeline one: by treating how the colors are presented as a way to represent the classification. One or more classifications could be chosen from a list, and the corresponding containers would appear.

Here is an example of what that may look like:

![Sketch of timeline with photo as photo frame, painting as paint tube, and sculpture as a vase, each symbol filled in with the corresponding color palette]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/classcolor_1.png)

This may not be the best way to represent classification, since it might be difficult or even essentializing to choose an object that represents Prendergast, or Eastern, for example. Additionally, the classifications don't all fall in the same category, and thus the icons would be inconsistent. It might be better to use medium as a way to filter objects, but medium is not a great attribute to use given the current dataset because of its inconsistentency (as discussed [previously](https://www.lester-lee.com/f2018-info-vis/2018/10/22/mored3/)). One way to avoid this problem would be to use labelled buckets, like so:

![Sketch of timeline with rectangles for photo, painting, and sculpture, each rectangle filled in with the corresponding color palette]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/sketches/classcolor_2.png)

Another problem with using classification is that some classifications wouldn't make sense with the timeline, as they categorize the pieces of a specific time period: most noticeably, the **ANCIENT** classification. In these cases, it may be better to leave out the timeline altogether.
